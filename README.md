# AI Security Camera

## Overview
This project involves the development of an AI-powered security camera system using Python. The system leverages body detection to start recording when a person is detected and stops recording when no person is present, thereby conserving storage space.

## Features
- Real-time body detection using OpenCV
- Automatic recording when a body is detected
- Stops recording when no body is detected to save space
- Integration of advanced facial expression recognition using the FER library
- Optimized for resource-constrained environments

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- FER (Facial Expression Recognition)
- TensorFlow
- Google Colab (for model training using L4 and T4 GPUs)
